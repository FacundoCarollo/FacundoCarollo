 'Hello Word!! ðŸ‘‹'

I am currently studying the Higher Technician in Systems Analysis. The technologies incorporated so far are C#.net and Sql Server, Javascript,Typescript and Angular.
I also took courses in a self-taught way and I participated in a workshop, thanks to these I managed to incorporate HTML5, CSS3,Git and Github.
